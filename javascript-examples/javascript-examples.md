JavaScript Tutorial
===================

This tutorial focuses in using JavaScript with a basic sigle-page HTML application to access SNOMED CT content from the IHTSDO Browser backend services.

To access the application, clone the repository and open the javascript-examples/index.html page in a browser.

```
git clone https://github.com/WestCoastInformatics/Snomed-In-5-Minutes.git
cd Snomed-In-5-Minutes
```

Then launch a browser pointing to the index.html file in that directory.
