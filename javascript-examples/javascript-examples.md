JavaScript Tutorial
===================

This tutorial focuses in using JavaScript with a basic sigle-page HTML application to access SNOMED CT content from the IHTSDO Browser backend services.

Simply open the [index.html](index.html) page to run the app.

Each call made will show the underlying URL and the JSON response.

To see how the javascript is called, see [app.js](app.js)
